This is a test file for the Encrypted Backup Framework.

It contains some sample text to test the file transfer functionality.
The system should be able to:
1. Read this file
2. Calculate its CRC checksum  
3. Encrypt it using AES-256-CBC
4. Transfer it to the server
5. Decrypt it on the server side
6. Verify the CRC matches

This tests the complete end-to-end workflow.
