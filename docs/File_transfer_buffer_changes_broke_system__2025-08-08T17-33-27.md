[ ] NAME:Current Task List DESCRIPTION:Root task for conversation __NEW_AGENT__
-[x] NAME:CRITICAL: Fix CRC Mismatch Issue - SOLVED! DESCRIPTION:✅ FIXED BY USER: Resolved the systematic CRC mismatch between client and server. 66KB file transfers now work successfully. Both web GUI and direct client transfers are functional again.
-[x] NAME:Investigate Root Cause of File Transfer Regression - SOLVED! DESCRIPTION:✅ FIXED BY USER: Root cause identified and resolved. File transfer system is now working with successful 66KB transfers.
-[-] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Enhanced Adaptive Buffer Management - SUPERSEDED DESCRIPTION:Implement intelligent buffer sizing (1KB-64KB) based on file size for optimal transfer performance. Currently reverted due to CRC issues.
-[-] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Advanced Memory Safety & Validation - SUPERSEDED DESCRIPTION:❌ SUPERSEDED: This task was superseded by the user's implementation. See the IMPLEMENTED version below.
-[-] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Cross-Platform Endianness Handling - SUPERSEDED DESCRIPTION:❌ SUPERSEDED: This task was superseded by the user's implementation. See the IMPLEMENTED version below.
-[-] NAME:MEDIUM PRIORITY: Enhanced Progress Reporting - SUPERSEDED DESCRIPTION:❌ SUPERSEDED: This task was superseded by the user's implementation. See the IMPLEMENTED version below.
-[-] NAME:MEDIUM PRIORITY: Intelligent Retry Logic - SUPERSEDED DESCRIPTION:❌ SUPERSEDED: This task was upgraded to HIGH PRIORITY with more comprehensive requirements.
-[-] NAME:MEDIUM PRIORITY: Advanced Error Handling - SUPERSEDED DESCRIPTION:❌ SUPERSEDED: This task was superseded by the user's implementation. See the IMPLEMENTED version below.
-[ ] NAME:LOW PRIORITY: Performance Monitoring DESCRIPTION:Add transfer speed monitoring, bottleneck detection, and performance analytics for optimization insights.
-[ ] NAME:LOW PRIORITY: Enhanced Security Features DESCRIPTION:Implement additional security measures like transfer integrity verification and enhanced encryption options.
-[ ] NAME:LOW PRIORITY: Code Cleanup & Optimization DESCRIPTION:Remove redundant code, optimize algorithms, and improve code organization for better maintainability.
-[x] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Cross-Platform Endianness Handling - IMPLEMENTED! DESCRIPTION:✅ IMPLEMENTED BY USER: Proper little-endian conversion functions (hostToLittleEndian16/32, isSystemLittleEndian) are working correctly. All network data is properly converted for Windows/Linux compatibility.
-[x] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Advanced Memory Safety & Validation - IMPLEMENTED! DESCRIPTION:✅ IMPLEMENTED BY USER: Comprehensive input validation (validateFileSizeForTransfer, validateAndAlignBufferSize), safe memory allocation with try-catch blocks, and proper error handling are all working.
-[x] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Enhanced Adaptive Buffer Management - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED! DESCRIPTION:✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED BY USER: Buffer validation and AES alignment are working. Dynamic buffer sizing logic is present. May need further optimization for different file sizes.
-[x] NAME:MEDIUM PRIORITY: Advanced Error Handling - IMPLEMENTED! DESCRIPTION:✅ IMPLEMENTED BY USER: Comprehensive error categorization (ErrorType enum), detailed error messages with context, and proper error handling throughout the codebase.
-[x] NAME:MEDIUM PRIORITY: Enhanced Progress Reporting - IMPLEMENTED! DESCRIPTION:✅ IMPLEMENTED BY USER: Detailed transfer statistics (TransferStats struct), real-time speed calculation, progress visualization with ETA estimates, and performance monitoring are all working.
-[ ] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Intelligent Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff DESCRIPTION:Implement sophisticated retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, jitter, and circuit breaker patterns. Current retry logic exists but needs enhancement for production reliability.
-[ ] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Robust Connection Health Monitoring DESCRIPTION:Add real-time connection quality monitoring, automatic dead connection detection, graceful reconnection handling, and connection pooling for reliability.
-[ ] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Transfer Cancellation & Interruption Handling DESCRIPTION:Implement user-initiated transfer cancellation, graceful handling of unexpected interruptions, and proper cleanup of partial transfers.
-[ ] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Large File Memory-Efficient Streaming DESCRIPTION:Implement streaming transfer for files larger than available RAM. Current approach loads entire file into memory, limiting scalability for large files (>1GB).
-[ ] NAME:HIGH PRIORITY: Comprehensive Timeout Management DESCRIPTION:Implement differentiated timeout strategies for connect, send, receive, CRC verification, and other operations to prevent hanging transfers in various network conditions.
-[ ] NAME:MEDIUM PRIORITY: Partial Transfer Resume & Recovery DESCRIPTION:Implement ability to resume interrupted transfers from the last successful checkpoint, reducing need to restart large file transfers from beginning.
-[ ] NAME:MEDIUM PRIORITY: Transfer Compression Support DESCRIPTION:Add optional compression for text files and compressible data to reduce transfer time and bandwidth usage, with automatic compression detection.
-[ ] NAME:MEDIUM PRIORITY: Bandwidth Throttling & QoS DESCRIPTION:Implement configurable bandwidth limiting and Quality of Service controls to prevent transfer from overwhelming network or impacting other applications.
