# Detailed explanations (below each package name is expanded with where/how it's used)
# pycryptodome (pycryptodome>=3.19.1):
#   Purpose: Provides Crypto.Cipher, Crypto.PublicKey, Crypto.Random and related
#   cryptographic primitives.
#   Where used: server-side file transfer and protocol handling uses AES and RSA
#   operations (see `python_server/server/*` imports such as `from Crypto.Cipher import AES`)
#   Notes: This is the project's primary low-level crypto library; many scripts
#   in `scripts/security/key-generation/` also import Crypto.* modules.
#
# psutil (psutil>=5.9.0):
#   Purpose: System and process utilities to inspect running processes, CPU/memory
#   Where used: `scripts/one_click_build_and_run.py`, server monitoring, and
#   some GUI/server helper modules that check for running instances or collect
#   resource metrics.
#
# Flask (Flask>=2.3.2):
#   Purpose: Lightweight WSGI web framework.
#   Where used: `api_server/cyberbackup_api_server.py` and health/debug endpoints
#   across the repo. Imported as `from flask import Flask, request, jsonify`.
#
# flask-cors (flask-cors>=6.0.0):
#   Purpose: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for Flask apps.
#   Where used: `api_server/cyberbackup_api_server.py` to allow the GUI (or browser)
#   to call the API when needed.
#
# flask-socketio (flask-socketio>=5.0.0):
#   Purpose: Adds Socket.IO support to Flask for real-time bidirectional events.
#   Where used: Optional realtime channels in the API bridge and server GUI.
#
# sentry-sdk (sentry-sdk>=2.8.0):
#   Purpose: Error reporting and telemetry.
#   Where used: Conditional Sentry initialization lives in `Shared/sentry_config.py`
#   and server GUI modules to capture exceptions in production.
#
# watchdog (watchdog>=2.1.0):
#   Purpose: File-system event monitoring (watch directories, react to changes).
#   Where used: Test helpers and optional file-watching utilities referenced in
#   docs/tests (`watchdog.observers` / `watchdog.events`).
#
# filetype (filetype>=1.2.0):
#   Purpose: Detect file types from magic bytes.
#   Where used: No direct import hits during scan (may be reserved for upload
#   content-type detection or legacy utilities). Kept for parity with older
#   branches where it was used.
#
# flet (flet>=0.28.3):
#   Purpose: Primary GUI framework used by `FletV2/` (views, theme, navigation).
#   Where used: Many files import `import flet as ft` (see `FletV2/views/*`).
#
# plyer (plyer>=2.1.0):
#   Purpose: Cross-platform native APIs (notifications, battery, vibration).
#   Where used: Optional; not widely imported in the main FletV2 codebase, but
#   kept to support platform features in examples and optional integrations.
#
# matplotlib (matplotlib>=3.7.0):
#   Purpose: Static plotting for charts/analytics.
#   Where used: Server GUI uses matplotlib in `python_server/server_gui/*` and
#   Flet docs reference Matplotlib integration (`flet.matplotlib_chart`).
#
# pydantic (pydantic>=2.11.7) & pydantic-core (pydantic-core>=2.33.2):
#   Purpose: Data validation and settings models (Pydantic v2).
#   Where used: Models, config parsing and some API schema handling. Docs and
#   fix notes reference Pydantic import issues; ensure compatible versions.
#
# httpx (httpx>=0.27.2,<0.28):
#   Purpose: Async HTTP client used by FletV2 for calling the local API without
#   blocking the UI thread.
#   Where used: `FletV2/utils/real_server_client.py` and some integration tests.
#
# aiofiles (aiofiles>=24.1.0):
#   Purpose: Async file reading/writing to avoid blocking the UI thread.
#   Where used: Several Flet views import `aiofiles` for non-blocking I/O.
#
# python-dotenv (python-dotenv>=1.0.0):
#   Purpose: Loads environment variables from .env files during local development.
#   Where used: Launchers and scripts that read `.env` for local dev flags.
#
# certifi / charset_normalizer / idna / urllib3 / requests:
#   Purpose: Standard HTTP libs and lower-level dependencies used by `requests`.
#   Where used: `requests` used by many scripts/tests; the others are dependency
#   and compatibility pins.
#
# pillow (pillow>=10.4.0):
#   Purpose: Image manipulation for server GUI assets and thumbnailing.
#   Where used: `python_server/server_gui/*` asset handling uses `from PIL import Image`.
#
# pygments (pygments>=2.19.0):
#   Purpose: Syntax highlighting for docs/tools and admin output; optional.
#
# pypiwin32 / pywin32:
#   Purpose: Windows-specific bindings used where Windows-only integrations are
#   required (services, native hooks).
#
# loguru (loguru>=0.7.0):
#   Purpose: Structured logging library used in scripts or optional debug tools.
#
# pytest (pytest>=7.0.0):
#   Purpose: Test runner used by the repository's `tests/` directory.
#
# ruff (ruff>=0.6.8):
#   Purpose: Linter/formatter for CI/dev workflows.
#
# cryptography (cryptography>=42.0.4):
#   Purpose: High-level cryptographic primitives (Fernet, certificate handling).
#   Where used: Optional; most runtime crypto uses pycryptodome, but cryptography
#   is kept for compatibility and examples.
#
# plotly / seaborn / numpy:
#   Purpose: Interactive plotting and statistical visuals (plotly/seaborn) and the
#   numeric base `numpy`. Primarily used in analytics/reporting and docs/examples.
#
# humanize (humanize>=4.7.0):
#   Purpose: Human-friendly formatting helpers (bytes, dates).
#
# textual / typer / click:
#   Purpose: CLI / TUI building libraries used by dev/admin scripts.
#
# python-bidi / wcwidth:
#   Purpose: Correct handling of BiDi (right-to-left) text and character width
#   calculations. `Shared/utils/utf8_solution.py` imports `bidi` and `wcwidth` to
#   initialize console handling correctly on Windows.
#
# rich (rich>=13.7.0):
#   Purpose: Rich console output for pretty tracebacks and developer tooling.
#
# websockets / sse-starlette:
#   Purpose: Optional async realtime libraries for raw websocket or SSE endpoints.
#   The main realtime path uses Flask-SocketIO, but these remain available for
#   experiments or ASGI endpoints.
#
# python-magic-bin (python-magic-bin>=0.4.14):
#   Purpose: libmagic binary for Windows; used for reliable file-type detection when
#   `filetype` or system libmagic is not available.
#
# xxhash (xxhash>=3.3.0):

#
# schedule / apscheduler:
#   Purpose: Scheduling utilities for periodic background tasks (simple vs advanced).
