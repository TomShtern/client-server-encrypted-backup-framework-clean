# App Structure & Navigation

The Flet documentation page on "App Structure & Navigation" lists several controls for building the structure and navigation of a Flet application.

These controls include:
*   **AppBar**: A Material Design app bar for the top of the application.
*   **BottomAppBar**: A Material Design app bar for the bottom.
*   **MenuBar**: A bar for managing cascading child menus.
*   **NavigationBar**: The Material 3 navigation bar component.
*   **NavigationDrawer**: A Material Design panel that slides in from the side.
*   **NavigationRail**: A widget for the left or right side of an app to navigate between a small number of views.
