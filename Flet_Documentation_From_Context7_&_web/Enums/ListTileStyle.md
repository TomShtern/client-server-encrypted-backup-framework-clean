# ListTileStyle

The `ListTileStyle` enum in Flet defines the font used for the `title` property of a `ListTile` control.

It has the following values:
*   **`DRAWER`**: This style uses a title font that is appropriate for a tile appearing within a `Drawer` component. In Flutter (which Flet is based on), this typically corresponds to the theme's `TextTheme.bodyLarge` style.
*   **`LIST`**: This style uses a title font suitable for a tile in a general list. This is the default value for the `style` property of a `ListTile`. In Flutter, this often corresponds to the theme's `TextTheme.titleMedium` style.
