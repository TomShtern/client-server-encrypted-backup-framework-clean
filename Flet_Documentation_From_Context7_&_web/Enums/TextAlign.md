# TextAlign

The `TextAlign` enum in Flet specifies the horizontal alignment of text within a control. It has the following values:

*   `LEFT`
*   `RIGHT`
*   `CENTER`
*   `JUSTIFY`
*   `START`
*   `END`

This enum is typically used with the `text_align` property of controls like `ft.Text` to control how the text is aligned.
