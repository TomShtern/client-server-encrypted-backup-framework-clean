# BarChartEvent

In Flet, `BarChartEvent` is an event that is fired when a bar within a `BarChart` control is either hovered over or clicked.

When you define an event handler for the `on_chart_event` property of a `BarChart`, this handler will receive an instance of `BarChartEvent` as an argument, allowing you to access details about the interaction.
