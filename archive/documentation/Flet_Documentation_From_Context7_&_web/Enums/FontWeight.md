# FontWeight

The `FontWeight` enum in Flet is used to specify the thickness of the glyphs used to draw text. It provides several predefined values and a numerical scale for finer control.

Here are the available values for `FontWeight`:
*   `NORMAL`: The default font weight, equivalent to `W_400`.
*   `BOLD`: A commonly used font weight that is heavier than normal, equivalent to `W_700`.
*   `W_100`: Thin, the least thick.
*   `W_200`: Extra light.
*   `W_300`
*   `W_400`: Normal.
*   `W_500`: Medium.
*   `W_600`
*   `W_700`: Bold.
*   `W_800`
*   `W_900`: Black, the thickest font weight.

These values correspond to a 9-point scale, where higher numbers represent bolder weights. You can use `FontWeight` when defining a `TextStyle` for text elements in Flet.
