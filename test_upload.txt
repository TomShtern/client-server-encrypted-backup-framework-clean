This is a test file for the improved backup system.
The client now supports direct configuration without transfer.info files.
File selection through the web GUI should work much better now!

Features implemented:
- Improved file picker fallback mechanism
- Static file caching in WebServerBackend
- Reduced polling frequency (10x improvement)
- Thread optimization
- Request debouncing
- Lazy loading of GUI components
- Direct configuration passing (no more transfer.info dependency)

This test verifies the complete file upload flow.
