ERROR: This is the default fallback file!

If you see this content in the server GUI, it means there is a BUG in the backup system:

1. The specified file in transfer.info was not found or could not be read
2. The C++ client fell back to this default file (which should NOT happen)
3. There is a problem with the file path handling or temp file cleanup
4. The backup system is NOT working correctly

DEBUGGING INFORMATION:
- This file should NEVER be transmitted to the server
- If you see this, check the transfer.info file
- Verify the specified file exists and is readable
- Check for temp file cleanup timing issues
- Look for any hardcoded fallback file logic

This is NOT your intended backup file!
