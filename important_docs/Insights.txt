  THIS FILE IS A COLLECTION OF INSIGHTS FROM THE RECENTLY EDITED FILES.
   EACH INSIGHT HIGHLIGHTS A KEY LEARNING OR BEST PRACTICE.
   THESE INSIGHTS CAN GUIDE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The classic async/sync mixing error: using await inside a synchronous
  function causes immediate Python runtime errors. In Flet, view creation
   functions are synchronous by design, so we need to use page.run_task()
   for async operations instead of direct await calls.

    ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Root Cause Identified: The error is AssertionError at line 812 in
  files.py: page.run_task(schedule_data_load). The problem is that
  schedule_data_load is not an async function, but page.run_task()
  requires a coroutine function. The Flet framework enforces this with an
   assertion: assert asyncio.iscoroutinefunction(handler).

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Field Mapping Mismatch: The mock data generator creates files with
  filename field, but the files view expects name field. Similarly, mock
  data has pathname but the view expects path, status vs status (this one
   matches), and modified field is missing in mock data (expects ISO
  format).

  Button Handler Issue: The buttons are using .get() with proper
  fallbacks, so the issue must be in the button event binding or the
  click handlers not being properly attached to the DataTable rows.

    ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Data Display Success: The mock data field mapping fix resolved the
  "unknown" values issue. The files view now properly displays file
  names, sizes, types, and other data because I added the missing field
  mappings (name, type, modified, owner, path) to match what the view
  expects.

  Button Investigation Strategy: I've added debug logging to all button
  click handlers in both clients and files views. This will help
  determine if:
  1. Button clicks are not being registered at all (DOM/event binding
  issue)
  2. Button clicks are registered but handlers fail (logic/exception
  issue)
  3. Button clicks work but don't provide user feedback (UI update issue)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

    ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The root cause is clear now: the event handlers exist in the Python
  code but are not being serialized to the Flet client. This suggests
  either a scoping issue with the handler functions, or a problem with
  when the handlers are created versus when the table is rendered.
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

    ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  The button handler issue was a fascinating technical discovery - it        
  revealed that Flet's event handler serialization has specific
  requirements. Function-based handlers created through factory functions    
   don't serialize properly, while inline lambda expressions work
  correctly. This is a key insight for future Flet development.
