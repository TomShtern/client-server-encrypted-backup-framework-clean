# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Develop a secure, encrypted backup framework using Python with Flet-based GUI, featuring client-server architecture, database integration, and comprehensive backup/restore capabilities.

## Key Knowledge
- **Framework**: Using Flet v0.28.3 for cross-platform GUI development with Python
- **Architecture**: Client-server model with encrypted communication and local database storage
- **Core Components**:
  - Main dashboard with analytics and metrics
  - Client management system with registration/authentication
  - File backup/restore functionality with encryption
  - Database integration for metadata and settings
  - Real-time logging and monitoring
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Python 3.x with asyncio for asynchronous operations
  - SQLite for local database storage
  - Cryptography for encryption/decryption
  - WebSockets for real-time communication
  - Flet for GUI components and theming
- **Key Conventions**:
  - Follow Flet best practices for async operations using `page.run_task()`
  - Use neumorphic and glassmorphic design principles (40-45% intensity)
  - Implement proper error handling with user feedback mechanisms
  - Maintain UTF-8 encoding support through custom solutions
  - Follow Material Design 3 guidelines for UI components

## Recent Actions
- Implemented core dashboard view with real-time metrics and analytics
- Developed client management system with CRUD operations
- Created file backup/restore functionality with encryption support
- Built database integration layer with table management capabilities
- Established logging and monitoring infrastructure
- Designed settings management system with configuration persistence
- Integrated server bridge for communication between GUI and backend
- Implemented responsive UI layouts with proper theme support
- Added navigation system between different views
- Created utility functions for common operations
