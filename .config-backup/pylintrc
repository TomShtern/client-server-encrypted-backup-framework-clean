# Legacy pylint configuration placeholder.
#
# The full configuration now lives in pylintrc.archive.ini within this
# directory. VS Code previously treated this file as Python code and
# surfaced hundreds of errors, so the heavy configuration was archived
# separately.
#
# To restore pylint, copy pylintrc.archive.ini to the repository root as
# .pylintrc (or point tooling at that archive file explicitly).
