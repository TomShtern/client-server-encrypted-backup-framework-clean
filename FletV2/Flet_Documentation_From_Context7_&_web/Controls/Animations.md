# Animations

Flet provides several controls for creating animations in your application.

Here are the available animation controls:

*   **AnimatedSwitcher**: This control performs a cross-fade transition between a new control and the one it previously displayed.
*   **Lottie**: You can use this to display animations from Lottie files, which can be loaded from a URL or a local file.
*   **Rive**: This control allows you to display animations from a Rive file, also loadable from a URL or a local file.
